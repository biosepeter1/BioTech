    "content": "Almost everyone has had Imposter Syndrome at some point in their life. I’m not smart enough for this — they’re so much better than me — I don’t deserve to be here. If you’ve had these thoughts, you’ve struggled with Imposter Syndrome, too. In college, I made myself the victim of Imposter Syndrome when I dropped out of a Computer Science major and instead graduated with a major in Biology.\r\n\r\nLess than 5 years after graduating, I started a job as one of two developers updating and maintaining a dynamic e-commerce site and am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. This is the story of how I got from there to here, and I hope it reaches someone who, like me, gave into these thoughts and left behind their dream. I hope I can convince you that failure and struggle are necessary, guaranteed, and the first steps to growth.\r\n\r\nIf you want the TLDR of how to succeed on your journey to web developer, scroll to the end and read the section — So, You Want to be An Engineer?\r\n\r\nDipping a Toe in Bioinformatics\r\nIn my first year of college, one of the available electives in my Biology major was Python Programming in Biology. It was for beginners and I decided why not, let’s see what programming is all about. I’d never written a line of code in my life. In the middle of the course, we were given a project to write an executable Python program that would accept a DNA fragment and reverse it, trim it, and blast it through a database to come up with an organism name. I remember loudly cursing in my dorm room as test after test failed.\r\n\r\nThen came the moment — I rewrote one line and all the tests passed. As student who had learned all the hacks of digesting and spitting information out or plug-and-chugging through problems, it was the toughest challenge I’d ever been given and solving it brought on a moment of pure joy. I really liked that feeling. At the end of that semester I applied for and was accepted in dual enrollment in Computer Science. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do yet, but I loved Biology and Computer Science and wanted to explore both.\r\n",

    "title": "Exclusive: Nvidia kept some China customers in the dark about new US chip clampdown, sources say",
    "content": "Nvidia Didn’t Warn Some Chinese Customers About U.S. Export Ban on H20 AI Chip**\r\n\r\nSINGAPORE, April 16 (Reuters) – Nvidia did not alert some of its key Chinese customers ahead of time about new U.S. export rules that now require a license to sell its China-specific AI chip, the H20, according to two people familiar with the situation.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. government informed Nvidia on April 9 that sales of the H20 chip to China would now need a special export license. Nvidia made this public on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe new restrictions are part of Washington’s ongoing efforts to curb China’s access to advanced semiconductors and maintain a competitive edge in artificial intelligence technology.\r\n\r\nAccording to the sources, major Chinese cloud service providers were still expecting to receive H20 chip deliveries later this year and were unaware of the change. Nvidia’s sales team in China also seemed to be in the dark until the public announcement. The sources requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the matter.\r\n\r\nNvidia has not commented on the situation.\r\n\r\nThese export limits could seriously impact Nvidia’s business in China, which is one of its biggest markets. Since early 2024, the company had secured about $18 billion in H20 orders, sources said. In the last fiscal year ending January 26, Nvidia generated $17 billion in revenue from China—about 13% of its total sales.\r\n\r\nFollowing the announcement, Nvidia's shares dropped by 6% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The company said it expects up to $5.5 billion in charges this quarter, ending April 27, related to inventory, order commitments, and reserves for the H20 chip.\r\n\r\nChinese tech giants like Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance had increased their H20 chip orders to support the growing demand for affordable AI models from companies like DeepSeek. However, none of the three firms have responded to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe H20 is the only Nvidia chip that the company is currently allowed to sell in China. It was introduced after the U.S. imposed stricter chip export rules in October 2023. Since 2022, the U.S. has blocked sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China due to fears they could be used to boost China’s military capabilities.\r\n\r\nWith the H20 now under restriction, analysts believe Chinese companies—especially Huawei—could benefit. Huawei offers its own AI chips and may attract customers shifting away from Nvidia.\r\n\r\n\"By restricting the H20, U.S. regulators are effectively pushing Nvidia's Chinese customers toward Huawei's AI chips,\" said Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital Partners in Singapore. “Huawei’s chip design and software could develop rapidly with more customers and real-world usage,” he added.",

    "content": "\r\nMost people using Windows 11 have already gotten the 24H2 update, but some users were stuck on an older version. This was because certain wallpaper apps were causing problems with the update, so Microsoft blocked it on affected devices while they worked on a fix.\r\n\r\nNow, six months later, those users can finally upgrade to version 24H2.\r\n\r\nAccording to an update on Microsoft’s “Windows 11, version 24H2 known issues and notifications” page, the company said:\r\n\r\n> “We have started to gradually remove this safeguard hold. If you try to install version 24H2 using Windows Update under Settings, Windows 11 Installation Assistant, or Media Creation Tool, you might receive a message requesting you to uninstall your wallpaper app. We also recommend updating the app, since a newer version might be compatible. Or you may uninstall, instead. After you complete this action, you will be able to finish installing version 24H2.\r\n>\r\n> Note that several wallpaper applications are currently included in this compatibility hold. For this reason, the specific timing of the resolution of this issue on a given device may depend on the application being used and the timing of that application's update. As new versions and updates are released for these applications by their respective developers, it's expected that these issues will be resolved.”\r\n\r\nNow that the update works with wallpaper apps, you might want to try one out. These apps offer more than just still images—you can even use animated or interactive wallpapers.\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested, check out the 20 best wallpapers on **Wallpaper Engine**, or see why **Lively Wallpaper** might be a better option.",

    "content": "April 16 (Reuters) – Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said on Wednesday it expects to incur charges of up to $800 million following new U.S. export restrictions on high-end processors to China, introduced under the Trump administration.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, rival chipmaker Nvidia announced on Tuesday it anticipates a significantly larger impact—$5.5 billion in charges—as the restrictions continue to limit access to one of the industry’s key markets. These latest curbs come amid ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and growing concerns over national security.\r\n\r\nShares of both AMD and Nvidia dropped more than 5%, pulling down broader tech stocks globally.\r\n\r\nAMD confirmed that the new export rules affect its MI308 chips. The U.S. Commerce Department stated on Tuesday that fresh licensing requirements now apply to advanced chips like Nvidia’s H20, AMD’s MI308, and similar models.\r\n\r\nChina was AMD’s second-largest market in 2024, contributing around $6.23 billion—over 24% of the company’s total revenue. The projected $800 million in charges will cover inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves, AMD noted in a regulatory filing.\r\n\r\nThe company said it plans to apply for export licenses, but added there's no guarantee any will be granted. According to analysts at Jefferies, the U.S. has never approved a license for graphics processor shipments to China.",

    "title": "How Ponzi Scheme CBEX Misled Nigerians With Fake Canadian Ties, Stolen Identity Of Chinese Government Firm",
    "content": "Many Nigerians are currently lamenting the loss of their investments in a suspected Ponzi scheme operated by CBEX.\r\n\r\nSaharaReporters reported that angry investors stormed the firm's office in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, carting away various items including tables, chairs, and other office equipment.\r\n\r\nThis report takes a closer look at the controversial company at the centre of the growing outrage.\r\nCBEX, which operates as a digital trading platform, is reportedly registered in Canada as a crypto trading exchange. However, checks by SaharaReporters on Canadian business registry platforms reveal that CBEX is not officially registered in Canada—despite the company’s Chief Executive Officer, Yahaya Ibrahim, reportedly claiming that it is headquartered there.\r\n\r\nThe closest match to CBEX in the Canadian business directory is a now-defunct entity named \"CBEX Capital Corp,\" whose license was revoked a year ago.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation suggests that the name “CBEX” may have misled Nigerian investors. The acronym is originally associated with the China Beijing Equity Exchange, a platform owned by the Chinese government used for mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring of state-owned enterprises.\r\n\r\nIt remains unclear why the Nigerian version of CBEX adopted the same name. This may have contributed to the false impression that the platform was backed by the Chinese government, especially as online searches for \"CBEX\" essentially lead to the legitimate Chinese state-run entity.\r\n\r\nChecks of digital footprints of the name \"CBEX\" link to the Chinese-owned government firm, which may have misled many Nigerians who may have checked the digital footprints of CBEX before trusting to invest.\r\n\r\nSaharaReporters had earlier detailed how, following the collapse of the CBEX platform, a group of enraged individuals looted its office in the Oke-Ado area of Ibadan, Oyo State. The attack, which took place on Monday evening, involved mobs forcibly entering the premises and removing furniture and equipment.\r\n\r\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the incident was triggered by the platform's sudden crash, which reportedly wiped out user account balances and rendered many investments worthless.\r\n\r\nAfter the collapse, affected users expressed grief and frustration on social media, sharing stories of lost funds and failed hopes.\r\n\r\nResponding to the situation, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reiterated that any platform not registered with the SEC is considered illegal. During a virtual session with fintech stakeholders on Monday, SEC Director General Emomotimi Agama stated: \"Recently, a post went viral concerning a certain platform and its activities. The fallout includes news of its closure and financial losses. I want to be very clear: if it is not registered, it is illegal.”\r\n\r\nWhile he did not directly mention CBEX, the timing and context strongly suggested he was referring to the controversy.\r\n\r\nOn X (formerly Twitter), a user with the handle @mrsean_Okwute commented: \"I'm just hearing the name CBEX. So Nigerians fell for another scam again? Now I understand why politicians have the nerve to do what they do. Some Nigerians really lack awareness.\"\r\n\r\nAnother user, @Rukkie339, posted: \"The streets are quiet—CBEX really did a number on investors. Never get involved in any investment promising 100% ROI. It's a clear scam. Reach out to friends and family, console—don’t mock. It's a tough time that leads to dark thoughts",

    "title": "Vibe Coding Vs. Traditional Software Development In 2025 - Programming",
    "content": "What is Vibe Coding?\r\n\r\nVibe coding represents a novel approach where developers interact with artificial intelligence (AI) tools to generate software through natural language prompts, rather than manually writing code. Coined by computer scientist Andrej Karpathy, vibe coding allows individuals to describe their desired application in plain English, enabling AI systems to produce functional code. This method emphasizes rapid prototyping and creative problem-solving over meticulous coding syntax and architecture.\r\n\r\n[url=\"https://www.aqila.ng/10-best-ai-website-builders-in-2025/37736/\"] Top 10 Best AI Website Builders in 2025[/url]\r\n\r\nThe Rise of AI-Driven Development\r\n\r\nThe integration of AI into software development is not a mere trend but a significant shift. By 2025, it’s projected that 80% of the software development lifecycle will involve generative AI code generation, enhancing developer productivity by up to 75% . Tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude by Anthropic exemplify this change, enabling developers to focus more on high-level design and less on repetitive coding tasks.\r\n\r\nTraditional Coding: Precision and Control\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the allure of AI-assisted development, traditional coding remains vital. It involves a deep understanding of programming languages, system architecture, and debugging processes. Traditional developers are responsible for writing, testing, and optimizing code, ensuring software reliability and performance. This meticulous approach is crucial for complex systems where precision and control are paramount.\r\n\r\nComplementary or Converging?\r\n\r\nRather than replacing traditional coding, vibe coding complements it by streamlining certain aspects of development. AI tools can handle repetitive tasks, allowing developers to concentrate on more complex and creative challenges. However, human oversight remains essential to address issues like security, ethical considerations, and nuanced problem-solving that AI may not fully comprehend.\r\n\r\nThe Future Outlook\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, the future of software development is likely to be a hybrid model that leverages both AI-driven tools and traditional coding expertise. Developers will need to adapt by acquiring skills in prompt engineering and AI tool integration, while maintaining a strong foundation in core programming principles. This balanced approach will enable the creation of innovative and reliable software solutions.",

    "content": "Despite repeated warnings, Nigerians continue to fall victim to Ponzi schemes promising quick returns. From MMM to CBEX, here’s a rundown of the most notable scams that have drained billions from citizens since 2016.\r\n\r\n1. MMM Nigeria (2016)\r\nThe most infamous Ponzi scheme in Nigeria’s history, MMM Nigeria promised returns of up to 30% within 30 days. The scheme attracted millions before it crashed in December 2016, leaving countless investors in financial ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Ultimate Cycler, Get Help Worldwide, Twinkas, iCharity Club, Loopers Club, Givers Forum (2016)\r\nThese platforms emerged in the shadow of MMM’s popularity. Using referral networks and cycling models, they lured thousands with mouthwatering promises, only to vanish within months.\r\n\r\nMy parents said shoemaking is for men, now my father calls me Joddu shoemaker and dances to...0:01 / 1:00\r\n\r\n\r\n3. NNN Nigeria, MMM Cooperation, GCCH, RevoMoney (2017)\r\nAfter the MMM crash, copycat schemes took over, rebranding old models with new names. NNN and MMM Cooperation tried to ride on the MMM name, exploiting previous participants who still hoped to recover losses.\r\n\r\n4. Bitclub Advantage, Million Money, Helping Hands International (2018)\r\nThese schemes masqueraded as crypto-based platforms or charity networks. They capitalized on the growing interest in digital currencies but delivered the same outcome — massive losses.\r\n\r\n5. Loom and Crowd1 (2019)\r\nViral social media campaigns fueled the rise of Loom and Crowd1. Promoters used WhatsApp and Facebook to promise “double your money” schemes that quickly collapsed when recruitment stalled.\r\n\r\n6. InksNation, Lion’s Share, Baraza Multipurpose Cooperative (2020)\r\nInksNation promised a digital currency that would end poverty but was shut down by the SEC. Baraza claimed to be a cooperative but operated like a classic Ponzi, while Lion’s Share mimicked MLM structures.\r\n\r\n7. Racksterli, Eagle Cooperative, 86FB (2020–2021)\r\nThese platforms used influencer marketing and sports betting gimmicks. 86FB, in particular, gained popularity before crashing spectacularly, taking millions from investors.\r\n\r\n8. FINAFRICA, Royal Q (Nigeria version), Ovaioza (2022)\r\nFINAFRICA used the lure of forex trading. Royal Q posed as a crypto trading bot, and Ovaioza claimed to store and sell agricultural produce. All failed to deliver on promised returns.\r\n\r\n9. CALA Finance, 6Dollars Investment, Sidra Investment, WealthBuddy, Compoundly (2023–2024)\r\nThese new-age platforms were heavily marketed online. Sidra was a clone scam, while others mimicked DeFi and crypto investment trends, using hype and bonuses to attract victims.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. BitFinance Global and CBEX (2025)\r\nIn the latest wave, BitFinance Global and CBEX are among the schemes already causing financial pain in 2025. They repeat the same patterns — false claims, unrealistic returns, and eventual disappearance.",
